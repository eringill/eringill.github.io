<h4>I am a data scientist & bioinformaticist with over 7 years of coding experience. I'm based in Vancouver, BC and am passionate about using data to tell stories and derive actionable insights.<br><br>
I have a PhD in genetics, but quickly learned that I enjoy analyzing data and solving problems with computers more than working in the lab.

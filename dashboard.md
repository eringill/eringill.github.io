Data Source
-----------
All data for this project are available from the [Government of Canada Infobase](https://health-infobase.canada.ca). Data are updated daily.

Motivation
----------
This is a reboot of my [canada_COVID-19_dashboard project](https://github.com/eringill/canada_COVID-19_dashboard) (which was written in a jupyter notebook and used bokeh for data visualization).
For this version, I wanted to create something that could be hosted on a server so that users can access it anywhere.
I've also made tweaks to how the data are processed and displayed.

The motivation for the original dashboard was to create something that users could interact with freely and explore - where the visualizations can do the talking.

The dashboard displays live graphs and charts of Canadian COVID-19 case and vaccination data.

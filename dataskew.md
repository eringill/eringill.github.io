About
-----
This program builds on the analyses conducted by the outlier detection program described [here](https://eringill.github.io/outlierdetection/). Instead of just identifying outliers, the outliers are removed from your dataset then a histogram of the data is plotted and the data are evaluated for skewness. This is important when deciding what statistical tests to run on a dataset and which assumptions may be invalidated.
